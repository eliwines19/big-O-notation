# big-O-notation

## BigO Notation is a method for determining an algorithms efficiency

## it is a way to check how long your code takes to run, and also how it performs when your input size increases

## time complexity - how long it takes to run in terms of computational steps

### this is also known as computational complexity or temporal complexity

## space complexity - amount of memory your code uses

## Big O is 'upper-bound', meaning it measures the worst case scenario, this is because the best case scenario doesnt tell us anything

## When an algorithm takes an array as an input of 'n' size, the formula is O(n) and performs O(1) work on each element

## Why do we need Big O Notation?

### our world of technology grows every day. It is filled wiht complex applications. When building applications, it is important to test its performance when your application is strained with loads of data so we can perform better than our competitors

## Variables that can contribute to your algorithms performance:

### underlying hardware
### Operating System
### CPU
### Processor

## It's important to note when calculating BigO Notation, we oftentimes don't consider these factors

## Key time and space complexities:

### Constant: O(1)
### Linear time: O(n)
### Logarithmic time: O(n log n)
### Quadratic time: O(n^2)
### Exponential time: 2 ^(n)
### Factorial time: O(n!)
